    "By correcting renaming and merging on the gender column, we've managed to eliminate some NA values in the outer join. Although an outer joins introduce NA values, they can also be helpful for discovering patterns in the data. For example, in our combined data, notice that the two patients who did not have values listed for height and weight only made visits to the ER. It could be that the hospital did not have patients 9 and 10 on record previously and that it does not take height and weight measurements for ER visits. Using the same type of intution, it could be that patients 3 and 6 have height and weight measurements on file from visits in the past, but perhaps they did not visit the hopsital during the time period for which this visit data was collected."
