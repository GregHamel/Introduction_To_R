# Introduction_To_R

This repo contains Jupyter notebooks used to create my 30 part introduction to R published on my blog. The index to the guide can be found here: http://hamelg.blogspot.com/2015/10/introduction-to-r-index.html

The notebooks in this repo are not fully edited for spelling, grammar etc.
