    "In our study of t-tests, we introduced the one-way t-test to check whether a sample mean differs from the an expected (population) mean. The chi-squared goodness-of-fit test is an analog of the one-way t-test for categorical variables: it tests whether the distribution of sample categorical data matches an expected distribuiton. For example, you could use a chi-squared goodness-of-fit test to check whether the race demographics of members at your church or school match that of the entire U.S. population or whether the computer browser preferences of your friends match those of internet uses as a whole.\n",

Tests dealing with categorical varaibles are based on variable counts instead of the actual value of the variables themselves.\n",
