    "In lesson 24 we introduced the t-test for checking whether the means of two groups differ. The t-test works well when dealing with two groups, but sometimes we want to compare more than two groups at the same time. For example, if we wanted to test whether voter age differs based on some categorical variable like race, we have to compare the means of each level or group the variable. We could carry out a separate t-test for each pair of groups, but when you conduct many tests you increase the chances of false positives. The analysis of variance or ANOVA is a statistical inference test that lets you compare multiple groups at the same time."

    "The one-way ANOVA tests whether the mean of some numeric variable differs across the levels of one categorical variable. It essentailly answers the question: do any of the group means differ from one another? We won't get into the details of carrying out an ANOVA by hand as it invovles more calculations than the t-test, but the process is similar: you go through several calculations to arrive at a test statistic and then you compare the test statistic to a critical value based on a probabilitiy distribution. In the case of the ANOVA, you use the \"f-distribution\", which you can access with the functions rf(), pf(), qf() and df().\n",

    "In this case, we see a low p-value for the interaction bewteen race and gender. A low p-value for the interaction term suggests that some group defined by a combination of the two categorical variables may be having a large influence on the test results. In this case, we added 10 to the ages of all asian women voters, while all other gender/race combinations are drawn from the same distribution. To identify the specific variable combination affecting our results, we can run Tukey's test and inspect the interactions:"
