    "The ggplot2 package can do everything we learned to do with R's base plotting functions and then some. The scaling and axes in ggplot2 make charts easier to read and while the syntax for plotting is a more verbose it follows a logical, step by step structure that makes it easy and powerful to work with. Base R's plotting functions are still useful for rapid plotting and first-brush data exploration, but ggplot2 is there if you need to take your plots to the next level."
